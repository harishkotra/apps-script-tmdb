# Apps Script with REST API

This repo helps you with fetching data from TMDb API into a Google Sheet using Google Apps Script.

Create a blank Google sheet and navigate to **Tools -> Script Editor** and paste the following code. We need three functions i.e., getTopMovies(), getPopularMovies() and onOpen().

* getTopMovies() – Fetch top movies from the API
* getPopularMovies() – Fetch popular movies from the API
* onOpen() – Create a custom menu to run REST API calls only when needed.
